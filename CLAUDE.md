# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the **Fractary Claude Code Plugins** repository, containing a collection of interconnected plugins that implement the FABER (Frame → Architect → Build → Evaluate → Release) workflow framework and supporting primitives for AI-assisted development.

## CRITICAL: Protected Paths - Never Edit Installed Plugins

**This repository is the SOURCE CODE for plugins.** When plugins are installed, they are copied to the user's home directory. You must NEVER edit the installed copies.

### Forbidden Paths (NEVER write to these locations):

- ❌ `~/.claude/plugins/` - Installed plugins directory
- ❌ `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/` - Marketplace plugin installations
- ❌ Any path starting with `/home/user/.claude/` or `$HOME/.claude/`
- ❌ Any path outside this repository's working directory (wherever this repo is cloned)

### Why This Matters:

1. **Changes to installed plugins are NOT committed to git** - They exist only in the user's home directory
2. **Changes are LOST when branches are deleted** - Since they're not in version control
3. **Changes don't propagate** - Other users won't receive your updates
4. **It's the wrong location** - The source code lives HERE in this repository

### Correct Behavior:

| Want to edit... | ✅ Correct Path | ❌ Wrong Path |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| faber plugin | `plugins/faber/...` | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/.../faber/...` |
| repo plugin | `plugins/repo/...` | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/.../repo/...` |
| work plugin | `plugins/work/...` | `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/.../work/...` |
| Any plugin | `plugins/{name}/...` | `~/.claude/plugins/...` |

### Common Mistake Example:

❌ **Wrong**: User asks "update the repo plugin to add feature X"
→ Claude edits `~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/fractary/plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/SKILL.md`
→ Changes are lost when branch is deleted

✅ **Correct**: User asks "update the repo plugin to add feature X"
→ Claude edits `plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/SKILL.md`
→ Changes are committed to git and propagate to all users

### Rule Enforcement:

**Before ANY file write operation, verify:**
1. The path starts with the current working directory (`/home/user/claude-plugins/` or similar)
2. The path does NOT contain `/.claude/plugins/`
3. The path does NOT start with `~/.claude/` or expand to the user's home `.claude` directory

**If you find yourself about to edit a file in `~/.claude/`:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Find the equivalent source file in this repository under `plugins/` (see [Directory Structure](#directory-structure) below)
3. Edit the source file instead

## CRITICAL: Command Names Must Include Full `fractary-` Prefix

**All plugin commands MUST be referenced with their full name including the `fractary-` prefix.**

Commands will NOT work without the proper prefix. The plugin system uses the full name from `plugin.json` to route commands.

### Command Naming Format

```
/fractary-{plugin-name}:{command-name}
```

### Examples

| ✅ Correct | ❌ Wrong |
|-----------|----------|
| `/fractary-faber:init` | `/faber:init` |
| `/fractary-faber:plan` | `/faber:plan` |
| `/fractary-faber:execute` | `/faber:execute` |
| `/fractary-faber:run` | `/faber:run` |
| `/fractary-faber:status` | `/faber:status` |
| `/fractary-repo:commit` | `/repo:commit` |
| `/fractary-repo:branch-create` | `/repo:branch-create` |
| `/fractary-repo:pr-create` | `/repo:pr-create` |
| `/fractary-work:issue-fetch` | `/work:issue-fetch` |
| `/fractary-faber-cloud:deploy-apply` | `/faber-cloud:deploy-apply` |

### Rule Enforcement

**Before recommending ANY command to the user:**
1. Check that the command name starts with `fractary-`
2. Use the format `/fractary-{plugin}:{command}`
3. NEVER use shortened forms like `/faber:*`, `/repo:*`, `/work:*`

**Common mistake to avoid:**
```
❌ "To execute this plan: /faber:execute plan-id"
✅ "To execute this plan: /fractary-faber:execute plan-id"
```

## Architecture

### Plugin Ecosystem

The repository contains **11 active plugins** organized by format and purpose:

**Core Plugins (9 - Fractary YAML Format):**

1. **Workflow Orchestrator:**
   - `faber/` - Core FABER workflow orchestration (Frame → Architect → Build → Evaluate → Release)

2. **Primitive Managers (8):**
   - `work/` - Work item management (GitHub Issues, Jira, Linear)
   - `repo/` - Source control operations (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) + Git worktree management
   - `file/` - File storage operations (R2, S3, GCS, Google Drive, local filesystem)
   - `codex/` - Memory and knowledge management with MCP server integration
   - `docs/` - Living documentation management with type-agnostic architecture
   - `logs/` - Operational log management with hybrid retention
   - `spec/` - Specification lifecycle management tied to work items
   - `status/` - Custom status line display showing git status and work context

**Meta Plugins (2 - Claude Code Format):**
   - `faber-agent/` - Plugin creation tools (agents, skills, commands, workflows)
   - `faber-cloud/` - Cloud infrastructure management (AWS, Terraform, deployment)

**Format Notes:**
- Core plugins converted to **Fractary YAML format** (plugin.yaml, agent.yaml, tool.yaml)
- Meta plugins remain in **Claude Code format** (.claude-plugin/plugin.json, agents/*.md, skills/*/SKILL.md)
- Fractary format enables framework-independent distribution via registry manifest system

### Three-Layer Architecture Pattern

All plugins follow a consistent **3-layer architecture** for context efficiency:

```
Layer 1: Commands (Entry Points)
   ↓
Layer 2: Agents/Managers (Decision Logic & Workflow Orchestration)
   ↓
Layer 3: Skills (Adapter Selection & Execution)
   ↓
Layer 4: Scripts (Deterministic Operations - executed outside LLM context)
```

**Key Benefit**: This separation reduces context usage by 55-60% by keeping deterministic operations (shell scripts) out of the LLM context.

### Component Responsibilities

- **Commands** (`commands/*.md`): Lightweight entry points that parse arguments and immediately invoke agents. Never do work directly.
- **Agents** (`agents/*.md`): Workflow orchestrators that own complete domain workflows, coordinate skill invocations, and manage state. Never do work directly.
- **Skills** (`skills/*/SKILL.md`): Focused execution units that perform specific tasks by reading workflow steps and executing scripts. Document their work upon completion.
- **Scripts** (`skills/*/scripts/**/*.sh`): Deterministic operations executed via Bash, outside LLM context.

### Plugin Manifest Format

**IMPORTANT**: This repository uses **two manifest formats**:

1. **Fractary YAML Format** (9 core plugins) - Framework-independent distribution
   - `plugin.json` - Plugin manifest with metadata and checksums
   - `agents/{name}/agent.yaml` - Agent definitions
   - `tools/{name}/tool.yaml` - Tool definitions

2. **Claude Code Format** (2 meta plugins) - Claude Code specific
   - `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - Plugin manifest
   - `agents/*.md` - Agent markdown files
   - `skills/*/SKILL.md` - Skill markdown files

**For Claude Code plugins** (.claude-plugin/plugin.json), the manifest has a **strict, minimal schema**. Use only these fields:

```json
{
  "name": "fractary-{plugin-name}",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Brief description",
  "commands": "./commands/",
  "agents": ["./agents/{agent-name}.md"],
  "skills": "./skills/"
}
```

**Required fields**:
- `name` (string) - Plugin identifier (format: `fractary-{name}`)
- `version` (string) - Semantic version
- `description` (string) - Brief description

**Optional fields**:
- `commands` (string) - Path to commands directory (e.g., `"./commands/"`)
- `agents` (array) - Array of agent file paths (e.g., `["./agents/manager.md"]`)
- `skills` (string) - Path to skills directory (e.g., `"./skills/"`)

**DO NOT USE** these fields in plugin.json (they will cause validation errors):
- ❌ `author` (belongs in marketplace.json only)
- ❌ `license` (belongs in marketplace.json only)
- ❌ `requires` (not part of schema)
- ❌ `hooks` (belongs in marketplace.json only)
- ❌ Array format for `commands` or `skills` (must be strings pointing to directories)

**Reference template**: `docs/templates/plugin.json.template`

**Common mistake**: Using detailed object arrays for commands/skills instead of simple directory paths. The plugin system auto-discovers files in the specified directories.

### Plugin Hooks (Marketplace-Level)

Hooks are registered in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, NOT in the plugin manifest:

```json
{
  "plugins": [{
    "name": "fractary-status",
    "hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"
  }]
}
```

**Hook Definition** (`plugins/{plugin}/hooks/hooks.json`):
```json
{
  "description": "Plugin hooks description",
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [{
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/script-name.sh"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

**Key Features**:
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` - Variable that resolves to plugin root directory (works in hooks array)
- Scripts stay in plugin, no per-project copying needed
- Plugin updates automatically propagate to all projects
- Hooks auto-activate when plugin installed

**Variable Expansion Behavior**:
- ✅ **Hooks array**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` is supported and expands at runtime
- ❌ **statusLine property**: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` NOT supported in hooks.json
- ℹ️ **statusLine configuration**: Must be set in project's `.claude/settings.json` using absolute path

**StatusLine Configuration** (in project's `.claude/settings.json`, NOT in hooks.json):
```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/{marketplace}/plugins/{plugin}/scripts/status-line.sh"
  }
}
```

Note: The install script for status-related plugins should write this configuration to the project's settings.json.

**Examples**: See `plugins/repo/hooks/hooks.json` and `plugins/status/hooks/hooks.json`

```

## Working with Plugins

### Configuration Files

Plugin configurations are stored in project directories and **SHOULD be committed to version control**:

- **FABER**: `.faber.config.toml` in project root
- **Plugins**: `.fractary/plugins/{plugin}/config.json`

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Config Path Standard**
- ✅ **Correct**: `.fractary/plugins/{plugin}/config.json` (flat structure)
- ❌ **Wrong**: `.fractary/plugins/{plugin}/config/config.json` (nested - DO NOT use)

Example config files (`plugins/{plugin}/config/config.example.json`) stay in the plugin source as templates. Only the runtime config uses the flat structure.

**Migration**: If you have configs at the old nested path, run:
```bash
./scripts/migrate-config-paths.sh --dry-run  # Preview changes
./scripts/migrate-config-paths.sh            # Apply migration
```

All configurations use environment variables for secrets (never hardcoded), making them safe to commit.

**Important**: See [Version Control Guide](docs/VERSION-CONTROL-GUIDE.md) for best practices.

Use presets as starting points:
```bash
cp plugins/faber/presets/software-guarded.toml .faber.config.toml
```

### Testing Workflows

To test a FABER workflow:
```bash
# Initialize configuration
/faber init

# Dry-run mode (no actual changes)
/faber run 123 --autonomy dry-run

# Assisted mode (stops before release)
/faber run 123 --autonomy assist

# Guarded mode (pauses at release for approval) - RECOMMENDED
/faber run 123 --autonomy guarded

# Check status
/faber status
```

### How to Invoke Agents

Agents are invoked using **declarative natural language**, not tool calls.

**Correct invocation**:
```
Use the @agent-fractary-repo:repo-manager agent to create a commit with the following request:
{
  "operation": "create-commit",
  "parameters": {
    "message": "Add CSV export",
    "type": "feat",
    "work_id": "123"
  }
}
```

**Incorrect invocation**:
- ❌ Skill tool with agent name
- ❌ Task tool with agent name
- ❌ Direct skill invocation (bypassing agent)

The plugin system automatically routes when you state you're using an agent. Simply declare that you're using the agent in natural language, and the system handles the rest.

**Agent types**:
- **@agent-fractary-repo:repo-manager** - Repository operations (commits, branches, PRs, tags)
- **@agent-fractary-work:work-manager** - Work item management (issues, labels, milestones)
- **@agent-fractary-file:file-manager** - File storage operations (R2, S3, local)

### Command Failure Protocol

**CRITICAL: This protocol MUST be followed without exception.**

When commands, skills, or agents fail:

1. **STOP immediately** - Do not attempt workarounds
2. **Report the failure** - Show the exact error to the user
3. **Wait for instruction** - User decides next steps
4. **NEVER bypass** - Do not use bash/git/gh CLI directly as fallback
5. **NEVER be "helpful"** - Do not invent alternative approaches

**Prohibited behaviors after a failure:**
- ❌ Using `git` commands directly when `/repo:commit` fails
- ❌ Using `gh` commands directly when `/repo:pr-create` fails
- ❌ Invoking a different skill as a workaround
- ❌ Constructing manual solutions that bypass the plugin architecture
- ❌ Fabricating error explanations - report exactly what the tool returned

**Required behavior after a failure:**
- ✅ Report the exact error message from the tool
- ✅ Ask the user how they want to proceed
- ✅ Wait for explicit instruction before taking any action

**Why this matters:**
- LLMs naturally want to "be helpful" by finding workarounds
- Workarounds bypass architectural guarantees (logging, safety checks, consistency)
- Fabricated solutions compound errors and make debugging harder
- The user must maintain control over how failures are handled

**Example scenario:**
```
Agent returns: "Skill invocation failed: commit-creator error"

❌ WRONG: "Let me just use git commit directly to help you..."
✅ RIGHT: "The commit-creator skill failed with this error: [exact error].
          How would you like me to proceed?
          1. Investigate the skill failure
          2. Retry the operation
          3. Something else"
```

### Provider Abstraction (Handler Pattern)

Multi-provider plugins use **handler skills** to centralize provider-specific logic:

```
skills/
├── core-skill/              # Invokes handler based on config
└── handler-type-provider/   # Provider-specific implementation
    ├── workflow/            # Operation-specific instructions
    └── scripts/             # Provider-specific scripts
```

Example from `faber-cloud`:
- `skills/infra-deployer/` - Core deployment logic
- `skills/handler-iac-terraform/` - Terraform-specific operations
- `skills/handler-hosting-aws/` - AWS-specific operations

Configuration determines which handler is active:
```json
{
  "handlers": {
    "iac": {"active": "terraform"},
    "hosting": {"active": "aws"}
  }
}
```

## Development Standards

### XML Markup Standards

All agent and skill files use **UPPERCASE XML tags** for structure:

```markdown
<CONTEXT>Who you are, what you do</CONTEXT>
<CRITICAL_RULES>Must-never-violate rules</CRITICAL_RULES>
<INPUTS>What you receive</INPUTS>
<WORKFLOW>Steps to execute</WORKFLOW>
<COMPLETION_CRITERIA>How to know you're done</COMPLETION_CRITERIA>
<OUTPUTS>What you return</OUTPUTS>
<HANDLERS>Handler skills to use (if applicable)</HANDLERS>
<DOCUMENTATION>How to document work</DOCUMENTATION>
<ERROR_HANDLING>How to handle errors</ERROR_HANDLING>
```

### Skills Must Output Start/End Messages

Skills output structured messages for visibility:

```markdown
🎯 STARTING: [Skill Name]
[Key parameters]
───────────────────────────────────────

[... execution ...]

✅ COMPLETED: [Skill Name]
[Key results summary]
[Artifacts created with paths]
───────────────────────────────────────
Next: [What to do next]
```

### Critical Design Principles

1. **Commands never do work** - Always immediately invoke an agent
2. **Agents never do work** - Always delegate to skills
3. **Skills read workflow files** - Multi-step workflows split into `workflow/*.md` files
4. **Scripts are deterministic** - All shell scripts should be idempotent and well-documented
5. **Documentation is atomic** - Skills document their own work as the final step
6. **Defense in depth** - Critical rules (e.g., production safety) are enforced at multiple levels

## Common Development Tasks

### Working with Git Worktrees

Git worktrees enable parallel development on multiple branches simultaneously. The repo plugin provides seamless worktree management.

**Create branch with worktree:**
```bash
# Single command creates both branch and worktree
/repo:branch-create "implement auth" --work-id 123 --worktree

# Result:
# - Branch: feat/123-implement-auth (created)
# - Worktree: ../repo-wt-feat-123-implement-auth (created)
# - Ready for parallel Claude Code instance
```

**Naming Convention:**
- Pattern: `{repo-name}-wt-{branch-slug}`
- Location: Sibling directory to main repository
- Example: `claude-plugins-wt-feat-92-add-git-worktree-support`

**List active worktrees:**
```bash
/repo:worktree-list

# Output:
# 1. feat/123-implement-auth
#    Path: ../repo-wt-feat-123-implement-auth
#    Work Item: #123
#    Created: 2025-11-12
#    Status: Active
```

**Remove specific worktree:**
```bash
/repo:worktree-remove feat/123-implement-auth

# Safety checks:
# - Warns if uncommitted changes exist
# - Requires --force to override
# - Prevents removal from within worktree directory
```

**Cleanup merged/stale worktrees:**
```bash
# Clean up merged branches
/repo:worktree-cleanup --merged

# Clean up stale worktrees (30+ days inactive)
/repo:worktree-cleanup --stale --days 30

# Dry run to preview
/repo:worktree-cleanup --merged --stale --dry-run
```

**Automatic cleanup on PR merge:**
```bash
# Explicit cleanup
/repo:pr-merge 123 --worktree-cleanup

# Without flag - prompts if worktree exists:
/repo:pr-merge 123
# Displays:
#   🧹 Worktree Cleanup Reminder
#   Would you like to clean up this worktree?
#   1. Yes, remove it now
#   2. No, keep it for now
#   3. Show me the cleanup command
```

**Parallel development workflow:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Work on feature A
/repo:branch-create "feature A" --work-id 100 --worktree
cd ../repo-wt-feat-100-feature-a
claude

# Terminal 2: Work on feature B (simultaneously)
/repo:branch-create "feature B" --work-id 101 --worktree
cd ../repo-wt-feat-101-feature-b
claude

# Both Claude instances work independently in separate worktrees
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use `--worktree` flag for parallel work on multiple features
- Clean up worktrees after PR merge to free disk space
- Use `/repo:worktree-cleanup --merged` regularly to prevent accumulation
- Worktree metadata tracked in `.fractary/plugins/repo/worktrees.json`

### Adding a New Platform Adapter

To add support for a new platform (e.g., GitLab to repo plugin):

1. Create platform scripts:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/scripts/gitlab/
   ```

2. Implement required operations (matching existing platforms):
   ```bash
   # Study existing platform first
   ls plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/scripts/github/

   # Implement equivalent scripts
   touch plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/scripts/gitlab/create-branch.sh
   touch plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/scripts/gitlab/create-pr.sh
   # ... etc
   ```

3. Update skill documentation:
   ```bash
   vim plugins/repo/skills/repo-manager/SKILL.md
   # Add GitLab-specific handler section
   ```

4. No agent changes needed! The 3-layer architecture isolates platform logic.

### Creating a New Plugin

Follow the plugin standards document (`docs/standards/FRACTARY-PLUGIN-STANDARDS.md`) and reference the DevOps plugin (`plugins/faber-cloud/`) as the canonical example.

Key steps:
1. Define manager agents (one per complete workflow)
2. Define skill units (one per focused task)
3. Determine if multi-provider (need handlers?)
4. Create configuration structure
5. Implement 3-layer architecture
6. Add XML markup to all agents/skills
7. Document with start/end messages

### Understanding the FABER Workflow

The FABER workflow is a universal creation lifecycle:

1. **Frame** - Fetch work item, classify, setup environment
2. **Architect** - Design solution, create specification
3. **Build** - Implement from spec
4. **Evaluate** - Test and review (with retry loop)
5. **Release** - Create PR, deploy, document

This pattern applies to:
- Software engineering (implemented in `faber/`)
- Infrastructure (implemented in `faber-cloud/`)
- Design, writing, data (planned)

### FABER v2.1 Architecture (Current)

FABER v2.1 uses a **universal workflow-manager architecture** with configuration-driven behavior and **automatic primitives**.

**Architecture**:
```
faber-director (lightweight command parser + automatic issue fetch)
  └─ faber-manager (universal orchestrator)
      ├─ frame (phase skill) - minimal, issue fetch is automatic
      ├─ architect (phase skill) - work type classification at entry
      ├─ build (phase skill) - branch creation at entry (automatic)
      ├─ evaluate (phase skill)
      └─ release (phase skill) - PR creation at exit (automatic)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Universal Manager** - Single faber-manager works across ALL projects via configuration
- **JSON Configuration** - Located at `.fractary/plugins/faber/config.json`
- **Dual-State Tracking** - Current state (state.json) + historical logs (fractary-logs)
- **Phase-Level Hooks** - 10 hooks total (pre/post for each of 5 phases)
- **Automatic Primitives** - Issue fetch, branch creation, PR creation are automatic (v2.1)
- **60% context reduction** - From ~98K to ~40K tokens for orchestration

**Automatic Primitives (v2.1)**:

Core workflow primitives are now automatic and don't need explicit step definitions:

| Primitive | Location | Trigger | Condition |
|-----------|----------|---------|-----------|
| Issue Fetch | faber-director Step 0.5 | Before workflow | work_id provided |
| Work Type Classification | Architect phase entry | Before Architect steps | Always |
| Branch Creation | Build phase entry | Before Build steps | work_type expects commits |
| PR Creation | Release phase exit | After Release steps | commits exist |

This means workflow configs are simpler - no need to define `fetch-work`, `create-branch`, or `create-pr` steps.
See `plugins/faber/skills/faber-manager/workflow/automatic-primitives.md` for detailed logic.

**Configuration Location**:
```
.fractary/plugins/faber/config.json  # Main config
.fractary/plugins/faber/workflows/default.json  # Workflow definition
```

**Configuration Structure** (v2.1 - simplified with automatic primitives):
```json
{
  "schema_version": "2.0",
  "workflows": [
    {
      "id": "default",
      "file": "./workflows/default.json",
      "description": "Standard FABER workflow"
    }
  ],
  "integrations": {
    "work_plugin": "fractary-work",
    "repo_plugin": "fractary-repo",
    "spec_plugin": "fractary-spec",
    "logs_plugin": "fractary-logs"
  }
}
```

**Workflow Definition** (v2.1 - note: Frame is empty, primitives are automatic):
```json
{
  "phases": {
    "frame": { "enabled": true, "steps": [] },
    "architect": { "enabled": true, "steps": [{"name": "generate-spec", "skill": "fractary-spec:spec-generator"}] },
    "build": { "enabled": true, "steps": [{"name": "implement"}, {"name": "commit", "skill": "fractary-repo:commit-creator"}] },
    "evaluate": { "enabled": true, "steps": [{"name": "test"}, {"name": "review"}], "max_retries": 3 },
    "release": { "enabled": true, "steps": [{"name": "update-docs", "skill": "fractary-docs:docs-manager"}] }
  },
  "autonomy": { "level": "guarded", "require_approval_for": ["release"] }
}
```

Note: No `fetch-work`, `create-branch`, or `create-pr` steps needed - these are automatic primitives.

**Dual-State Tracking**:
- **Current State**: `.fractary/plugins/faber/state.json` (for workflow resume/retry)
- **Historical Logs**: `fractary-logs` plugin with workflow log type (complete audit trail)

**Initialization**:
```bash
# Generate default FABER configuration
/fractary-faber:init

# Creates .fractary/plugins/faber/config.json with baseline workflow
```

**Validation**:
```bash
# Validate configuration
/fractary-faber:audit

# Check completeness score and get suggestions
/fractary-faber:audit --verbose
```

## Tool Philosophy

The Fractary ecosystem addresses fundamental challenges in agentic AI development:

- **Forge** (future) - Maker's workbench for authoring primitives and bundles
- **Caster** (future) - Distribution and packaging to registries
- **Codex** - Memory fabric solving the agent memory problem
- **FABER** - Universal maker workflow orchestration
- **Helm** (future) - Runtime monitoring, evaluation, and governance

Current focus: FABER workflow + primitive managers (work, repo, file, codex)

## Important Notes

- **Context Efficiency**: The 3-layer architecture is designed to minimize token usage. Keep deterministic operations in scripts, not in agent/skill prompts.
- **Provider Agnostic**: Plugins work with multiple platforms via handler abstraction. Never hardcode platform-specific logic in agents.
- **Safety First**: Production operations require explicit confirmation. Multiple layers enforce critical safety rules.
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior is determined by configuration files, not code changes.
