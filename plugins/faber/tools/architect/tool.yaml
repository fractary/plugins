  execution_pattern: |
    The architect skill follows a skill-based execution pattern:
    1. Load workflow implementation from workflow/basic.md
    2. Execute steps defined in workflow:
       - Analyze requirements from Frame phase
       - Research existing codebase patterns
       - Design technical approach
       - Create/refine specification
       - Identify dependencies and risks
       - Update session state
       - Post architect complete notification
    3. Return structured result with specification and design details
